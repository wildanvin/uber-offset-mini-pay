# Uber Offset

This app uses the Toucan Protocol, Google Maps API and the new MiniPay wallet from Opera Browser to offset CO2 emitted by your car rides.

## Live Demo

Checkout the dapp [live](https://uber-offset-mini-pay-nextjs.vercel.app/), it is running on the Celo mainnet so you will need some money to use it. It will be cents I promise! and you will be offsetting some CO2 üòÅ

## Scaffold-ETH 2

For the front end I used Scaffold-ETH 2 because I like the different components and details that they have incorporated for dapp development. However, at the moment it doesn't support MiniPay out of the box. So if you fork Scaffold-ETH 2 to start a new project and you want to add support for MiniPay you have to modify:

- `Header.tsx`: at `packages/nextjs/components/Header.tsx`
- `wagmiConnectors.tsx`: at `packages/nextjs/services/web3/wagmiConnectors`

You can modify them to something similar that I have in this repo.
